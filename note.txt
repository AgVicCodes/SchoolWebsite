Started working on the project again on 09-10-2024

Needed to install php (xampp) and composer to run project

autoload file wasn't found when I ran `php artisan serve`

to solve that i used composer update to install necessary
packages

upon hosting the project, encountered laravel 500 server
error

to fix that I had to create an .env file, copy the reqs
from .env.example file and generate key using
`php artisan key:generate`

Up next, add tailwindcss for styling and 
add map info in about the school
